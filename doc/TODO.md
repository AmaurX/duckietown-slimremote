## TODOs

- [ ] use non-blocking image retrieval in robotremote and re-send ping if img isn't coming after 3 retries
- [x] add identifier to images before they are being sent so that one PC can receive images from multiple different robots. - DONE / not necessary anymore since images are automatically retrieved by host. So multiple duckies can be observed at once
- [ ] - deal with slow subscribers (implement "suicidal snail")
- [ ] - test how multiple subscribers impact cam timing.
